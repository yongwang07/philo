What I did in this assignment:
1. I finished all REQUIRED tasks and OPTIONAL tasks
2. what I extra did is added flash message when chosed a episode to playlist
   and using drab and drop to reorder the playlist and animate when removed one 
   episode in playlist

how to play it:
1. I added a Playlist link in sidebar so click this link would open playlist
2. initially playlist is empty. so choose one of four category audio source, 
   open it, when hover audio item, a pen icon would show in right top corner,
   click this icon would add this episode to playlist, a flash message would show up
   said: XXXXX added to playlist
3. then open playlist would see a list of episode your chose in step 2.
   hover it would show a delete icon in right top corner, click it would remove this episode
   drab this item then move it up or down would reorder playlist.
4. click one episode in playlist would start to play audio, when this episode play done,
   would automatically start to play next one episode in playlist


what I will do in the future:
1. added future to let user can control audio play
2. support search function so allow user to find his favour episode to add into playlist
3. support more optiomal way to load episode efficiently. i.e. loaded extra episode when scroll 
   down to bottom.
4. beatiful audio play UI

since I added new libaray, so please run npm install firstly.
